The analysis on the question: "Does the approval rating of a President influence the rate of babies named after them?" has no absolute values.

In the file "approval_analysis.R" they take the name rates for the first and last name with respect to the total population. (as seen in lines 14 and 15)
Once they ave done that, they chose to normalize them before they put them in the graphs. As a result, there were no absolute numbers that would create a discrepancy between generations due to the  differing populations.
